      An about page is a place for people to get to know you. You should include
      your interests, and things you are good at, and in general you should pull
      back enough of the curtain into your life to interest a potential employer
      in you as a person.

      My name is Skylar Rogers and I am an aspiring Web Developer currently
      looking for a position to begin an earnest career. I am a Deliverer,
      Philomath, Problem Solver, Peacekeeper, and Coach. I want to use my skills
      to contribute to the exciting advances that happen every day in web
      developing for your company. I am graduating from the Fullstack Academy in
      2023 with a certification in Web Development. While I am in school, I work
      at Amazon and within the first 3 months I took on more responsibility, as
      one of the first selected to become a Safety Ambassador when the program
      first launched, learned ship clerking/data analytics to back up and assist
      in operations, and display the leadership skills I learned as a Team Lead
      at Target. I continue to develop my leadership and web development skills,
      as I look forward to the opportunity to bring my experience and skill sets
      to your Team.
