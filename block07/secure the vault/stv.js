/* After creating and tagging the necessary documents, I want to create the alert in JavaScript. 
Using alert and parenthesis then creating a string in inside of them it creates the pop up alert with the assigned text displayed. 
Then I assigned num1,num2,num3 vaules that equate to the combination. 
Finally I added the console command to have the combination display in the console. */
